                    In many inverse problems we want to detect, locate or classify objects. In the context of electromagnetic detection of objects in the eddy current regime polarization tensors can be used to represent the effect of an object on the field. We show how the symmetries of the object can be understood inter terms of harmonic polynomials invariant under groups. We also show how the real and imaginary parts of the rank 2-tensor can be used for classification and discuss the measurement of how the eigenvectors differ. While ML is a powerful tool for classification, novel algebra and geometry also arises in these problems. This is joint work with Paul Ledger and James Elgy.

                    Image reconstruction in optical tomography is an ill-posed problem that needs to be approached in the framework of inverse problems. Computational solutions of this problem require modelling of light propagation. In biological tissues, the radiative transfer equation or its approximations are used as light transport models. In this talk, utilising the radiative transfer equation in optical tomography is discussed. Especially, the use of approximative models and modelling of the related errors and uncertainties are studied.

However, the sequential nature of its data acquisition limits its capacity to visualize dynamic processes with high temporal resolution and conventional image reconstruction techniques applied to dynamic CT result in considerable motion artifacts. While more sophisticated dynamic image reconstruction methods can improve upon the spatial and temporal resolution to some extend, the full potential of dynamic CT is not yet realized. We propose a multiscale temporal learning approach to accelerate the Time-dependent Deep Image Prior and enhance reconstruction quality. Our framework integrates these techniques into real-world dynamic CT applications, leveraging deep generative models in an unsupervised setting. We validate its effectiveness on both simulated and real data, demonstrating faster convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity.</div>

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging (SPI) has recently become a key imaging technique in microscopy, significantly reducing the cost of multispectral and time-resolved systems. SPI relies on compressive sensing theory and requires retrieving the image from multiple measurements – dot products between the sample and structured light. In practice, current approaches solve an ROF model for the compressed noisy measurements and use orthogonal pseudorandom patterns for illumination. We show that we can achieve higher compression and quality by leveraging data to learn the patterns and the reconstruction function, accelerating scientific discoveries in fluorescent microscopy.</div>

We design a specialized loss function that outperforms two-step approaches and surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised CT reconstruction in correlated noise scenarios. A key assumption is knowledge of the noise distribution, which we assess through ablation studies to determine required parameter accuracy.</div>

                    Abstracting system behavior into mathematical models is essential for science and engineering. Scientific discovery requires reconciling noisy data with incomplete background knowledge of universal laws. Historically, models were derived deductively from first principles—yielding interpretable, universal models from limited data, but demanding significant expertise and time. Meanwhile, statistical AI enables rapid model construction with remarkable scalability due to predetermined functional structures. However, these approaches often produce non-interpretable models requiring extensive training data and showing limited generalization. This talk examines recent efforts to bridge statistical and symbolic AI. We'll discuss algorithms that search for free-form symbolic models without predetermined structures or primitives. We'll review innovations in automated theorem proving (ATP) for certifying hypothesis models against background theory. Finally, we shall explore approaches to unify these complementary methods.

                    A central tool in Survival Analysis is the Cox Model. We argue that despite its utility in as a ranking objective there are potentially better alternatives for time to death prediction, with an example application to Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. A second issue we address is how to interpret medical images to identify biomarkers. We argue that standard perturbative methods such as GradCam are unreliable and we provide a robust alternative that is inherently interpretable. We apply the method to identifying biomarkers of IPF in CT scans, revealing very different results than standard perturbation analysis.

                    Inverse problems are about the reconstruction of an unknown physical quantity from indirect measurements. Most inverse problems of interest are ill-posed and require appropriate mathematical treatment for recovering meaningful solutions. Regularization is one of the main mechanisms to turn inverse problems into well-posed ones by adding prior information about the unknown quantity to the problem, often in the form of assumed regularity of solutions. Classically, such regularization approaches are handcrafted. Examples include Tikhonov regularization, the total variation and several sparsity-promoting regularizers such as the L1L1 norm of Wavelet coefficients of the solution. While such handcrafted approaches deliver mathematically and computationally robust solutions to inverse problems, providing a universal approach to their solution, they are also limited by our ability to model solution properties and to realise these regularization approaches computationally. Recently, a new paradigm has been introduced to the regularisation of inverse problems, which derives regularisation approaches for inverse problems in a data driven way. Here, regularisation is not mathematically modelled in the classical sense, but modelled by highly over-parametrised models, typically deep neural networks, that are adapted to the inverse problems at hand by appropriately selected (and usually plenty of) training data. In this talk, I will review some machine learning based regularisation techniques, present some work on unsupervised and deeply learned (weakly) convex regularisers and their application to image reconstruction from tomographic measurements.

                    In recent years, new regularization methods based on (deep) neural networks have shown very promising empirical performance for the numerical solution of ill-posed problems. Due to the nonlinearity of neural networks, these methods often lack satisfactory theoretical justification. In this talk, we rigorously discuss the convergence of one unsupervised approach utilizing untrained convolutional neural networks to represent solutions to linear ill-posed problems. The regularization property of the approach relies solely on the architecture of the neural network instead. We shall show that the classical discrepancy principle is an adequate method for early stopping of two-layer untrained convolutional neural networks learned by gradient descent, and furthermore, it yields an approximation with minimax optimal convergence rates. Numerical results are also presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.

                    Learning regularization schemes for inverse problems more often than not do use data with a fixed noise level. We use a somewhat simplified abstract analytical model in order to analyse the effect of applying such methods to data with different noise levels. As a start we analyse how classical regularzation schemes such as Tikhonov, where the regularization parameter is chosen according to some noise level, behave when applied to data with rather different noise levels. This is joint work with M. Iske.

                    Sobolev Spaces are useful both for the formulation of Inverse Problem and the incorporation of, e.g., smoothness properties or statistics of their solution.
                    As a result, the Sobolev embedding operator and its adjoint are common components in both iterative and variational regularization methods for the computation of a solution.
                    However, while the embedding operator itself is trivial, its adjoint is typically not, and the study of its properties and different representations is of importance both theoretically and practically.
                    Hence, in this talk we will present different characterizations of the adjoint embedding operators and their use in standard Tomography, Atmospheric Tomography and Photoacoustic Tomography.

When using state-of-the-art implicit priors, the posterior can only be accessed by sophisticated sampling techniques. In sequential OED (sOED), we adapt the sensing pattern during the measurement process. Due to prohibiting real-time implementations, we explore solving sOED using reinforcement learning (RL): RL attempts to learn a policy, i.e., a mapping of the current posterior distribution to a probability distribution over which sensing pattern is best to choose next.</div>
